# Supabase Database Backup with GitHub Actions

This repository provides a seamless way to automate backups of your Supabase database using GitHub Actions. It creates daily backups of your databaseâ€™s roles, schema, and data, and stores them in your repository. It also includes a mechanism to easily restore your database in case something goes wrong.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Daily Backups:** Scheduled backups run every day at midnight.
- **Role, Schema, and Data Separation:** Creates modular backup files for roles, schema, and data.
- **Flexible Workflow Control:** Enable or disable backups with a simple environment variable.
- **GitHub Action Integration:** Leverages free and reliable GitHub Actions for automation.
- **Easy Database Restoration:** Clear steps to restore your database from backups.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. **Setup Repository Variables**

Go to your repository settings and navigate to **Actions > Variables**. Add the following:

- **Secrets:**

  - `SUPABASE_DB_URL`: Your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string. Format:  
    `postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:5432/postgres`

- **Variables:**
  - `BACKUP_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable backups or `false` to disable them.

### 2. **How the Workflow Works**

The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on:

- Pushes or pull requests to the `main` or `dev` branches.
- Manual dispatch via the GitHub interface.
- A daily schedule at midnight.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Checks if backups are enabled using the `BACKUP_ENABLED` variable.
2. Runs the Supabase CLI to create three backup files:
   - `roles.sql`: Contains roles and permissions.
   - `schema.sql`: Contains the database structure.
   - `data.sql`: Contains table data.
3. Commits the backups to the repository using an auto-commit action.

### 3. **Restoring Your Database**

To restore your database:

1. Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing your backup files.
3. Run the following commands in order:

```bash
supabase db execute --db-url "<SUPABASE_DB_URL>" -f roles.sql
supabase db execute --db-url "<SUPABASE_DB_URL>" -f schema.sql
supabase db execute --db-url "<SUPABASE_DB_URL>" -f data.sql
```

This restores roles, schema, and data, bringing your database back to its backed-up state.
Workflow Toggle

Use the BACKUP_ENABLED variable to control whether backups are executed:

    Set to true to enable backups.
    Set to false to skip backups without editing the workflow file.

## Requirements

    A Supabase project with a PostgreSQL database.
    Supabase CLI installed for manual restoration.
    A GitHub repository with Actions enabled.
